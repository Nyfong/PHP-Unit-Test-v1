# 🚀 Full PHP App Setup with PHPUnit and HTML Test Reports

## 🧱 1. Project Structure

Your project will look like this:

```
php-app/
├── src/
│   └── Calculator.php          # PHP class for basic functionality
├── tests/
│   └── CalculatorTest.php      # PHPUnit test for Calculator
├── public/
│   └── index.php               # Web entry point
├── reports/
│   └── (HTML test results here) # Test reports will be stored here
├── composer.json               # Composer dependencies and settings
└── phpunit.xml                 # PHPUnit configuration file
```

---

## 🛠️ 2. Step-by-Step Setup

### ✅ a) Initialize the Project

Run these commands to create and initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir php-app && cd php-app
composer init -n
```

This will set up your **`composer.json`** file with basic settings.

### ✅ b) Install PHPUnit

Next, install PHPUnit for testing purposes:

```bash
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```

---

## 🧮 3. Sample Functionality - `Calculator.php`

Now, create a simple **Calculator** class with an **add** method. Save this in **`src/Calculator.php`**.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Calculator {
    public function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }
}
```

---

## 🧪 4. Unit Test - `CalculatorTest.php`

Next, we’ll write a basic PHPUnit test to validate that the **add** method works. Save this in **`tests/CalculatorTest.php`**.

```php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use App\Calculator;

class CalculatorTest extends TestCase {
    public function testAdd() {
        $calc = new Calculator();
        $this->assertEquals(5, $calc->add(2, 3));
    }
}
```

---

## ⚙️ 5. PHPUnit Config - `phpunit.xml`

We need to configure PHPUnit to generate a **code coverage report** in **HTML format**. Create the **`phpunit.xml`** file in your project root.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
         colors="true"
         stopOnFailure="false">
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="App Test Suite">
            <directory>tests</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>

    <logging>
        <log type="coverage-html" target="reports" />
    </logging>
</phpunit>
```

> ☝️ The key part here is `<log type="coverage-html" target="reports" />`. This tells PHPUnit to generate an HTML report inside the `reports/` folder.

---

## 🌐 6. Web Entry Point - `index.php`

Let’s add a simple web interface. This file will handle the basic functionality of your app and display results. Save it as **`public/index.php`**.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use App\Calculator;

$calc = new Calculator();
echo "2 + 3 = " . $calc->add(2, 3);
```

To run this with a local server, use:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Now, visit **`http://localhost:8000`** to see the output:  
`2 + 3 = 5`

---

## 🧪 7. Run Tests & Generate HTML Report

You’re almost done! To run the tests and generate the HTML coverage report, use:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html reports
```

💥 Boom! Your test results will be available in the `reports/` directory. Open **`reports/index.html`** in your browser to see a fancy, styled report.

---

## 🤓 Optional: Add Autoloading

If you prefer a more modern setup, you can add **autoloading** to your project so that you don’t need to manually include files.

Update your **`composer.json`**:

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "App\\": "src/"
    }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

This will let you use **PSR-4 autoloading**, which means you can call classes without needing to include them manually. 🙌

## 🌟 Extra Credit: Next Steps

Want to go even fancier? Here are a few ideas to level up:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI/CD)**: Set up automatic testing with a CI tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run tests on every push.
2. **Slack Notifications**: Send test results directly to Slack, so your team can stay updated.
3. **Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to track test results over time, using a tool like **Jenkins** or **GitHub Pages** to display the reports.

---

## 🚀 Summary

You now have a clean, functional **PHP app** with PHPUnit integration and a stylish **HTML test report**. Here’s a recap:

- **Project Structure**: Simple and organized.
- **PHP Unit Test**: Validate your functionality with a test.
- **HTML Test Report**: Get a visually appealing test result.
- **Composer Autoloading**: Optional step for a more modern project setup.
